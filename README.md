# OBJECTIVE
To design a 16-bit CPU by integrating smaller building blocks (i.e., ALU, DMEM, IMEM, RF sub-modules) and an instruction decoder as a complete CPU datapath. Then to integrate the datapath with the corresponding controller of the specified instruction set. You will build the sub-modules first, then integrate them into a working CPU.
Let us call our 16-bit processor “ADSD-RISC”.
